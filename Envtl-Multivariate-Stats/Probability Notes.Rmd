# Finding probability density


The distribution of X is binomial, with a mean of 10 and a SD of 0.5
X ~ Binomial(10, 0.5)
So the probability of X is equal to 5
Pr(X = 5)
Expected value is the mean

*Finding probability density with simulation*
rbinom(number of flips, number of coins, probability)

*Calculate the exact probability density*
dbinom(the outcome we're estimating the density at, the number of coins, and the probability)

*Cumulative density*
The probability that X<4 (Pr(X<4))
pbinom(probability of value, with number of flips, probability)

If you flip ten coins that each have a 30% probability of heads, what is the probability at least five are heads?
# Calculate the probability that at least five coins are heads
1 - pbinom(4, 10, .3)

# Confirm your answer with a simulation of 10,000 trials by finding the number of trials that result in 5 or more heads.
mean(rbinom(10000, 10, .3) >= 5)

Expected values
E[X] = size * p
Variance
Var(X) = size * p * (1-p)
